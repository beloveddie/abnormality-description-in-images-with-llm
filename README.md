# abnormality-description-in-images-with-llm
This project combines state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing to create an intuitive application for detecting and understanding abnormalities in images. Leveraging YOLOv5 for object detection and Llama 3 for generating detailed explanations, users can upload an image to identify anomalies and receive clear, insightful interpretations. This solution is designed for diverse use cases, from healthcare imaging to general anomaly detection, making complex insights accessible and easy to understand.
